                         The code journey is one I never thought I would be treadking. 
                         A passiong for music signing, songwriting, being a drummer
                         and bass player led me to a degree in sound engineering. 
                         Which introduced me to the tech world and brought me here.
                         Of course life is never that linear or easy but here I am!
